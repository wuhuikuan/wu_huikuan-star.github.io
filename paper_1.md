        <h3>Optimization Research of Small Molecule Induced Mouse Somatic Cell Reprogramming Technology</h3>
        <p>ABSTRACT
        <p style="text-indent:2em">The emergence of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) has promoted the development of regenerative medicine. However, the safety problems of the method of transcription factor induced reprogramming have always restricted the application and development of iPS technology. Small molecular compounds have the characteristics of cell permeability, reversibility and easy production, and can be fine tune to achieve different effects by changing the concentration and combination. Therefore, compared with transcription factor induced reprogramming, chemical methods have unique advantages. However, the chemical method has a long induction period and low induction efficiency, which affects the further application.
