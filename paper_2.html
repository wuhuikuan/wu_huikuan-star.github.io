        <h3>Optimization Research of Small Molecule Induced Mouse Somatic Cell Reprogramming Technology</h3>
        <p>ABSTRACT
        <p style="text-indent:2em">The emergence of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) has promoted the development of regenerative medicine. However, the safety problems of the method of transcription factor induced reprogramming have always restricted the application and development of iPS technology. Small molecular compounds have the characteristics of cell permeability, reversibility and easy production, and can be fine tune to achieve different effects by changing the concentration and combination. Therefore, compared with transcription factor induced reprogramming, chemical methods have unique advantages. However, the chemical method has a long induction period and low induction efficiency, which affects the further application.
        <p style="text-indent:2em">In this study, a stable CiPSCs induction system was established by optimizing the existing CiPSC methods.Results show, the GOF-MEF passaged three formed XEN-like clones in stageⅠof reprogramming(Fig.1B), and were induced in FBS/KSR culture medium in stageⅡ, and finally transformed into CiPS cells expressing green fluorescence in stageⅢ of N2B27 culture medium(Fig.1C,D). The induction period of this method is 28 days(Fig.1A). qPCR results showed that during the stageⅠof reprogramming, the expression levels of XEN genes Sall4 and Sox17, as well as the MET marker gene Epcam, increased gradually with the increase of induction days, the mesenchymal marker genes Snail and Slug gradually decreased(Fig.1E); Reprogramming on day 12 of the stageⅡ, the expression levels of 2C gene Zscan4 and Tcstv1 and early pluripotency gene Oct4 were higher than MEF cells, and the difference was extremely significant (p＜0.01)(Fig.1F). In the stageⅡof reprogramming, XEN-like clones proliferated stably in FBS/KSR medium, qPCR results showed that clones induced in FBS / KSR medium had significantly higher expression of Sall4 gene than clones induced in 20% KSR medium (p＜0.05)(Fig.2).Pluripotent detection display, the CiPS cells stably expressed pluripotency proteins: Oct4, Sox2, Nanog and SSEA1(Fig.3B), can differentiate into embraoid bodies in vitro, expressed ectodermal gene Nestin, mesodermal gene Bry and endodermal gene GATA4(Fig.3C), and can form teratomas in vivo(Fig.3D).
        <p style="text-indent:2em">Further, A natural antioxidant, phycocyanin, was added to the induction system. In the stageⅠ of chemical reprogramming, the expression levels of Sox17 and Snail genes were increased after 4 days of phycocyanin treatment compared with those without phycocyanin treatment (p＜0.05), and Sall4, Epcam and Slug genes expression levels were not significantly different; Compared with the control without phycocyanin treatment after adding phycocyanin for 8 days in the stageⅠ, Sall4 (p＜0.05), Sox17 (p＜0.01), Epcam (p＜0.01), Snail (p＜0.01) and Slug (p＜0.01) genes expression were significantly downregulated. This indicated that phycocyanin inhibited the expression of XEN gene in the stageⅠ of reprogramming(Fig.4D). Added phycocyanin to the stageⅡ of reprogramming for 12 days, The expression levels of Zscan4 and Tcstv1 were significantly increased compared with the control (p＜0.05), At the same time, the expression of telomerase gene Tert was also significantly higher than control (p＜0.05)(Fig.4E). In summary, this study established a stable CiPSC induction system to shorten the induction cycle of non-primary cell initiation. The addition of phycocyanin into this induction system can promote the expression of 2C gene, but the efficiency of phycocyanin induction in CiPS cells needs further study. This study provides technical and theoretical support for the establishment of more efficient and rapid induction of CiPS cells in the future.
